          Octemberk is the BEST! We could clearly differentiate our brand's sales before and after having a website. Before the website, we were literally struggling to get new customers and make any sales. Fortunately, I received a cold call from Octemberk. I tried their model website, and they taught me everything, from product uploads to order verification, inside and out.

Impressed with the easy handling, I hired them to build my Premium E-commerce website. Gradually, sales increased day by day, and now we are processing more than 50+ orders daily, which is a profitable boost. We expanded our business—it’s truly a dream come true for any online business owner.

Now, we are relieved from the stress of searching for new clients, which is the toughest part of any online business. We are fully satisfied as we now have a website that not only drives sales but also helps us handle our customers smoothly.

Thank you, Octemberk, for this tremendous growth in such a short span!

          </div>
          <div className="testcontent">
          Octemberk made an awesome website within our budget. Our story began when we searched for many companies to build our website. One company quoted ₹96,000, and another quoted ₹89,000. Since their prices were very high, we didn't proceed. Other companies were willing to build our website but quoted above ₹60,000, which was still out of our budget.

One of our customers recommended Octemberk for its reasonable pricing. Their price difference was ₹60,000 lower than the market rates, so we purchased their Premium E-commerce Service. I'm not sure if I should share this, but we got it for just ₹39,999. The delivery was on time, and the website has a top-notch, aesthetic look.

As a very well-known saree brand, we are thrilled with the overwhelming response from our customers and team. We will definitely reach out to the Octemberk team for our next project, especially given their affordable pricing.

We have been working with Octemberk for a long time. Collaborating with Octemberk was a game-changer for us. In today’s digital age, not having a strong online presence can make a business seem less credible. Like other tools, such as social media for online business, a website is also an incredible tool. Some businesses understand this and make more money online, while others still struggle to sell products.

From the very beginning, Octemberk understood our vision and provided us with a beautiful website. We transitioned from a struggling, outdated website created by another web design agency—which was a waste of time and money—to a fully functional one. We selected the Premium E-commerce package for our website. We wish we had approached Octemberk from the start.

Now, we are thrilled to see many orders being dispatched every single day and to witness the transformation of our maximum social media page visitors into instant buyers through our website.

          Every online business owner must think about how many more sales they could make if they had a website working 24/7 to bring in customers. With a website, they could achieve more sales than they could ever imagine. Many are missing a digital business strategy to boost their sales.

I can't even imagine running an online business without a proper e-commerce website. How long can they manage their customers through WhatsApp and Instagram DMs? In reality, most customers leave a page if they have to DM for product prices and then wait for a reply from the business owner. That's a funny way to lose customers to another brand's website!

A website is a mirror of a company's identity—it gives it a face and a soul. Octemberk made us look far more professional. We've received countless compliments on both our jewelry and our website! Just leave it to them and trust them; they will bring the BEST to the table.

Thank you for the wonderful website and the countless support. [(Happy to see women entrepreneurs emerging! :-)]

          Our e-commerce sales skyrocketed! The sooner we start, the sooner we can see the benefits of a website working for our business. Thankfully, we didn’t wait too long to decide whether to build a website or not; otherwise, we would have missed out on so many sales and so much money.

Special thanks to the team! Our brand now feels more professional, and customers love the easy navigation and quick checkout process. I love the fact that I can call them anytime I need help, and they always take care of it for me. Their customer service is excellent, and I am now building another Premium E-commerce website with them for our upcoming jewelry brand.

We are very happy with the results. So why wait to take advantage of the same success? We highly recommend their services to anyone looking to grow their online business—it’s 100% worth the money!

Our sales have increased significantly! A website should not be considered an expense in online business—it's an investment that generates more customers and sales for us. (We are now selling more than 300+ orders per month, which is huge! :-).

Handling clients has become much easier for us. We are now relieved from the stress of replying to DMs from clients and managing payment verification, as everything is handled automatically by our website. This allows us to fully focus on marketing.

The admin panel is my favorite feature. I never imagined that product uploads and order displays could be this simple. With just one click, I can now update order statuses without worrying about constant DMs and queries from clients about their orders.

Octemberk has completely changed our perspective on online business. I can't imagine running an online business without an e-commerce website. Great work! We are happy to have become good friends along the way.
